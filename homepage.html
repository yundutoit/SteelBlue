            <p>There are aliens envading your planet! In order to keep it safe, you need to use your anti-alien cannon to blast them out of the sky. Here's how to operate your cannon.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Type out the unique word on each UFO</li>
                <li>Press enter when you finish writing the word to fire!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Careful, typing the incorrect letter won't load your cannon! As you shoot down more UFOs, the difficulty will steadily increase.
